# money-clock
A basic website that shows how much you've earned while it is running.

## TODO
1) Add annual salary option in the income input
2) Save progress if the tab is closed using cookies so you can keep counting
3) Update to work even if computer is closed (use and store time from computer rather than own clock)
3) Allow user to update salary without reseting counter
4) Add reset button
5) Does it lag for a tiny bit when you click out of the tab?
6) Make it prettier
7) Add goals / animations / graphics
8) Add profiles buttons to see how much certain people make (billionares, teachers, etc)
9) Add little footer with works to my stuff and a donate button
10) Host website online!! (maybe use render.com ?)
