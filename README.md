# money-clock
A basic website that shows how much you've earned while it is running.

## TODO
1) Add annual salary option in the income input
2) Save progress if the tab is closed using cookies so you can keep counting
3) Allow user to update salary without reseting counter
4) Add reset button
5) Does it lag for a tiny bit when you click out of the tab?
